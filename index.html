    <p>
    I was born in Romania, and at 4 years old I moved to the US where I have <br>
    lived for over 15 years, but every chance I get, I travel back to my home <br>
    country and I visit as many historical and natural sites as possible. My <br>
    top 3 favorite sites and places I've been, and I recommend to anyone traveling <br>
    for their first time to Romania, more specifically the Transylvanian region, <br>
    are the following:
    <ol>
        <li>Corvin Castle, Hunedoara</li>
        <li>Balea Lac/Transfagarasan, Cartisoara</li>
        <li>Salina Turda, Turda</li>
    </ol>
