    <section><h2>Top 3 Places to Visit in Transylvania, Romania</h2>
    <p><img src="Visit-Corvin-Castle_1.jpg" alt="Corvin Castle Image"></p>
    <p>
    I was born in Romania, and at 4 years old I moved to the US where I have <br>
    lived for over 15 years, but every chance I get, I travel back to my home <br>
    country and I visit as many historical and natural sites as possible. My <br>
    top 3 favorite sites and places I've been, and I recommend to anyone traveling <br>
    for their first time to Romania, more specifically the Transylvanian region, <br>
    are the following:
    <ol>
        <li>Corvin Castle, Hunedoara</li>
        <li>Balea Lac/Transfagarasan, Cartisoara</li>
        <li>Salina Turda, Turda</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To begin with my favorite destination in Transylvania, the Corvin Castle, <br>
    I've always had a connection to this place ever since I was 3, as it was the <br>
    first place I remember visiting as a child. I was always facinated with medieval <br>
    knights and castles, and as far as medieval castles in Eastern Europe go, I think <br>
    this is a very underrated and lesser known wonder, primarily becuase of the rich <br>
    history and the way it's been beautifully restored and maintained. It stands as <br>
    one of the best examples of Gothic architecture in Eastern Europe, and I would say <br>
    it's also one of the most beautiful castles in the world. Besides its beauty one of <br>
    the best features about this castle, is that it's almost 100% explorable, with visitors <br>
    allowed to see almost every part of the castle. Wanna see the royal bedrooms? Go right <br>
    ahead. Wanna see the view from the main tower? Why not take a selfie while you're up <br>
    there? It's overall a fantastic experience and regardless of your age, everyone can't help <br>
    but feel like they're a kid again when they visit this magnificient castle.</p>
    <p>The next destination I strongly recommend for anyone traveling to Transylvania, is <br>
    Balea Lac, and the Transfagarasan(the mountain upon which the lake is located). <br>
    This lake and mountain are one of the most beautiful combinations that nature has <br>
    made in Romania. Being situated at one of the tallest mountains in Romania, this lake <br>
    is a clean and beautiful sight for the travelers once they reach the peak. Besides <br>
    the crystal clear and beautiful lake, the perhaps more magnificient thing about this <br>
    place is the view from the top of the mountain. You look upon the mountain ranges and <br>
    roads leading up to the mountainn, and you can see shepards with flocks of sheep, the <br>
    nearby cities and the beautiful waterfall that falls from the lake. This place is more <br>
    than a breath of fresh air in this busy and crazy world, and reminds us how beautiful <br>
    nature is. No one will ever be disappointed to visit this natural wonder of Romania.</p>
