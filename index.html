    <section><h2>Top 3 Places to Visit in Transylvania, Romania</h2>
    <p><img src="Visit-Corvin-Castle_1.jpg" alt="Corvin Castle Image"></p>
    <p>
    I was born in Romania, and at 4 years old I moved to the US where I have <br>
    lived for over 15 years, but every chance I get, I travel back to my home <br>
    country and I visit as many historical and natural sites as possible. My <br>
    top 3 favorite sites and places I've been, and I recommend to anyone traveling <br>
    for their first time to Romania, more specifically the Transylvanian region, <br>
    are the following:
    <ol>
        <li>Corvin Castle, Hunedoara</li>
        <li>Balea Lac/Transfagarasan, Cartisoara</li>
        <li>Salina Turda, Turda</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To begin with my favorite destination in Transylvania, the Corvin Castle, <br>
    I've always had a connection to this place ever since I was 3, as it was the <br>
    first place I remember visiting as a child. I was always facinated with medieval <br>
    knights and castles, and as far as medieval castles in Eastern Europe go, I think <br>
    this is a very underrated and lesser known wonder, primarily becuase of the rich <br>
    history and the way it's been beautifully restored and maintained. It stands as <br>
    one of the best examples of Gothic architecture in Eastern Europe, and I would say <br>
    it's also one of the most beautiful castles in the world. Besides its beauty one of <br>
    the best features about this castle, is that it's almost 100% explorable, with visitors <br>
    allowed to see almost every part of the castle. Wanna see the royal bedrooms? Go right <br>
    ahead. Wanna see the view from the main tower? Why not take a selfie while you're up <br>
    there? It's overall a fantastic experience and regardless of your age, everyone can't help <br>
    but feel like they're a kid again when they visit this magnificient castle.</p>
    <p>The next destination I strongly recommend for anyone traveling to Transylvania, is <br>
    Balea Lac, and the Transfagarasan(the mountain upon which the lake is located). <br>
    This lake and mountain are one of the most beautiful combinations that nature has <br>
    made in Romania. At the top of one of the tallest mountains in Romania, this lake <br>
    is a clean and beautiful sight for the travelers once they reach the peak. Besides <br>
    the crystal clear and beautiful lake, the perhaps more magnificient thing about this <br>
    place is the view from the top of the mountain. You look upon the mountain ranges and <br>
    roads leading up to the mountainn, and you can see shepards with flocks of sheep, the <br>
    nearby cities and the beautiful waterfall that falls from the lake. This place is more <br>
    than a breath of fresh air in this busy and crazy world, and reminds us how beautiful <br>
    nature is. No one will ever be disappointed to visit this natural wonder of Romania.</p>
    </p>The last recommendation on my list is called Salina Turda, a salt mine located in the <br>
    city of Turda. This natural mine has been excavated decades ago, producing salt for <br>
    Romania, and once mining operations were halted the mine was turned into a wellness <br>
    center and tourist location. After entering the mine, and going down long tunnels you <br>
    reach the main excavation area, that is over 400 feet deep, where you see a ferris-wheel, <br>
    small cafes, and a boat ride in the naturally formed lake in a crevise of the mine. <br>
    Besides visiting the mine for fun, there are many people who visit this mine for wellness <br>
    as the air in the mine is heavily salinated, and helps with lung problems and infections. <br>
    This is one of the most unique experiences I've ever had in Romania, and I would recommend <br>
    it to anyone who wants to visit a cave turned amusement park, or someone who is looking <br>
    into halotherapy(healing through breathing salinated air).

    <section><h2>My Favorite Fall/Winter Fragrances You Should Consider Wearing</h2>
    <p><img src="" alt=""></p>
    <p>
    My hobby and love for fragrances has started many years ago, and almost all my life I've <br>
    been wearing cologne, but my real passion for researching and studying fragrances was <br>
    kicked off heavily when I started working in perfume sales at a mall close to where I <br>
    grew up. Over the years I've worn, studied, and dealt in fragrances and I've learned all <br>
    the tricks, been able to recognize almost any cologne, and I even considered going into <br>
    Perfumery school at one point. With Fall here, and the upcoming winter just on the <br>
    horizon, I dicided that I would share some of my favorite fragrances to wear during this <br>
    time of the year.</p> 
    <h3>Parfums De Marly: Layton Royal Essence</h3>
    <p>This beauty of a fragrance is what I think of when I see Fall is here and the weather is <br>
    getting colder. Released in 2016 by Parfums De Marly, Layton Royal Essence has a very warm, <br>
    woodys, and crisp smell. With notes like apple, vanilla, sandalwood, and jasmine I've never <br>
    had an occasion where I don't get a compliment wearing this fragrance. The longevity easily <br>
    surpasses 8 hours, and the strong projection lasts for at least 4 hours. Besides that, what I <br>
    love even more about this fragrance is that it works both in casual and formal curcimstances. <br>
    The only downside to this fragrance is that it is pretty costly, starting at $235 for just a 75 ml.
    </p>
    <h3>YSL La Nuit De L'Homme</h3>
    <p>A more popular and well known fragrance, YSL's La Nuit De L'homme was released in 2009, and <br>
    became an instant best seller, and for good reason. This fragrance is a very warm, spicy and <br>
    sweet fragrance, with notes like cardamom, bergamot and vetiver. This is very much an evening <br>
    or night time fragrance, it lasts over 6-7 hours on the skin, and projects for over 2 hours. <br>
    One of the nice things about this fragrance is that for the quality of the fragrance the price <br>
    starts at only $60 for a 60ml, making it a great value fragrance for this time of year.
    </p>
    <h3>Armani Prive Oud Royal</h3>
    <p>One of my favorite colognes of all time is Oud Royal from Armani's Prive collection of fragrances. <br>
    Originally released in 2010, this put Armani's Prive collection in the spotlight for many fragrance <br>
    collectors and fanatics. The rich notes that include amber, oud, incense and rose make this a very <br>
    warm, spicy and smoky fragrance that combines oriental ingredients to create a very unique fragrance. <br>
    This is a very formal and cold weather oriented fragrance, with a longevity of over 10 hours, and a <br>
    projection of around 4-6 hours. However this beast does come at a price of $290 for a 100 ml, but if <br>
    you want to invest in a very high quality and unique fragrance, I would say that saving up money for it,<br>
    is very worth it.
    </p>
    <h3>Victor&Rolf Spicebomb Extreme</h3>
    <p>The main fragrance that introduced me into the world of cold weather fragrances is Spicebomb Extreme <br>
    by Victor&Rolf, which was released in 2015. This fragrance to me smells like Christmas in a bottle, with <br>
    notes like vanilla, tobacco and black pepper, this has a very sweet and spicy smell that almost everyone <br>
    whos smelled this fragrance, adores. This is a very casual fragrance that seems to last forever, I've even had <br>
    cases where people will tell me the next day that they like the way my cologne smells. The projection is <br>
    fantastic as well, averaging around 3-4 hours. The price of a 100 ml is $125 which I find very reasonable <br>
    for such a long lasting and pleasent fragrance, plus the grenade shaped bottle is very unique, and a nice <br>
    bottle to display in your bathroom/bedroom.
