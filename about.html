    <main><h2>Who is Rares?</h2>
    <p>I, Rares, am a 19  year-old Junior at MSU studying information science. <br>
    I am originally from Romania, but I've lived in the United States for over 15 years.<br>
    My main hobbies and favorite pass-times are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Singing</li>
        <li>Traveling</li>
        <li>Fragrances</li>
        <li>Cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have traveled from Europe to the US from a very young age, and I travel<br>
    as often as I can, ideally once a year if not more. I have worked as a perfume<br>
    salesman before at a mall, and ever since I've fallen in love with fragrances, <br>
    and I'm always researching different and new fragrances. I've learned how to <br>
    cook these past few years, ever since I've moved to MSU, and it's one of the <br>
    most relaxing and rewarding hobbies I've discovered, and I can't wait to learn <br>
    even more recipes! As far as singing goes, I think that it's one of my most favorite <br>
    hobbies and passions I have. I've sung at church, and by myself at home but recently <br>
    I've started taking professional voice lessons to better learn how to do different <br>
    voice techniques, and how to better control my voice. All of these hobbies have <br>
    become a part of my identity, and make me happier than ever. Once again, welcome <br> 
    to my blog, It's been a pleasure to introduce myself and I hope you enjoy reading <br>
    thorugh my posts and content!</p></main>
